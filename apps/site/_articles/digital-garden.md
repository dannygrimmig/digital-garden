After asking around for advice on how to grow in the software engineering space, a common piece of advice has been continuous learning; better yet, continuous learning in public. Here I want to detail the what, why, and how behind creating this cite.

## What is a Digital Garden?
> "Gardens are never finished, they're constantly growing, evolving, and changing." - Maggie Appleton

The gist of it is, a digital garden is a domain space to explore, write, and share any topic at any stage in the completion process. Unlike a blogs that are perfectly polished and neat, a garden can be ever changing and growing.

There are lots of great articles detailing the idea of a digital garden, such as:
* [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)
* [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/)
* [Thunk Notes](https://www.thunknotes.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-garden)



## Why did I make this?
To me, this digital garden is going to be a space where I can learn in public (see [Learn In Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public)). Rather than keeping my notes in a private notion as I currently do, this will be a space to learn as I go, and document things I find interesting.

## How I made this site
This digital garden is a Next.js site, created within a monorepo using NX. The bones of the site are created through a helpful tutorial on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/), an incredible resource for learning web development. [Architect an Extensible Digital Garden with Next.js, Tailwind, and Nx](https://egghead.io/courses/architect-an-extensible-digital-garden-with-next-js-tailwind-and-nx-53f7628f) walks through managing monorepos with NX, utilizing server side rendering with next js, and styling with tailwind, and this article will summarize my learnings.

*In a later article, I can detail the specifics of this site (as much of the NX and Next.js has changed since the courses creation)*
