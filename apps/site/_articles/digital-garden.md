After asking around for advice on how to grow in the software engineering space, a common piece of advice has been continuous learning; better yet, continuous learning in public. Here I will detail the what and why behind creating this site, and finally the how. 

## What is a Digital Garden?
> Gardens are never finished, they're constantly growing, evolving, and changing. - "Maggie Appleton"

The gist of it is, a digital garden is a domain space to explore, write, and share any topic at any stage in the completion process. Unlike a blogs that are perfectly polished and neat, a garden can be ever changing and growing. Kinda a throw ideas out and see where it goes...

There are lots of great articles detailing the idea of a digital garden, such as:
* [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)
* [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/)
* [Thunk Notes](https://www.thunknotes.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-garden)



## Why did I make this?
This digital garden is going to be a space learn about topics that interest me. I am hoping that writing about topics I am learning will help reinforce the lessons, helping me grow.
